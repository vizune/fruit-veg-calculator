Icons:

SVG for performance
Colour to stand out but strong outline for colour blindness and prominence
Need to be offline so progressive web app

Challenge 1 - how do we handle variations of a fruit or veg e.g. red, white, spring onions?
Challenge 2 - Icons that look very similar e.g. leeks and spring onions so the title needs to be prominent and can't rely on icon alone
Chanllenge 3 - What about garlic and ginger? Should I make a herb category?
